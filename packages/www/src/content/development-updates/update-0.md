# Day One: Starting Development

Authors: Robert Shalders & LLMs - _16th November 2024_

## Introduction

Welcome to _Flight Academy_ and more specifically the development updates posts! This is the first post of many, in which I will write updates as to the features, progress and overal state of the Flight-Academy Uk project. Please note, as I have a busy job as a full-stack developer, I am only able to do so much. Also for the sake of time management, I will be using LLMs to assist in the creation of these posts. To ensure transparency, I will include prompts & extra information regarding the use of AI.

## Welcome to Flight-Academy

Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey: the development of Flight-Academy, a platform designed to transform flight school management. Our goal is simple but ambitious: to create honest, transparent software that truly benefits the aviation community.

## Built for Public Benefit

Flight-Academy isnâ€™t just software; itâ€™s a commitment to making a difference. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s open-source. Whether you prefer to host it on your own infrastructure or take advantage of our managed service, the choice is yours. We believe software should serve the community, not lock it in.

## Passion Meets Expertise

As a full-time full-stack developer specialising in backend technologies, aviation has always been more than a passing interestâ€”itâ€™s a passion. With Flight-Academy, Iâ€™m combining technical expertise with a deep love for aviation to give back to a field that inspires me every day.

## Letâ€™s Collaborate

This project thrives on collaboration. Whether youâ€™re a fellow aviation enthusiast or a developer with fresh ideas, your input is invaluable. Found a way to make it better? Raise a ticket or submit a PR on GitHub. Together, we can shape Flight-Academy into a tool that serves the aviation world.

## The AI Copilot

Lastly, a cheeky confession: some of this content may have had a little AI-assisted lift-off (thanks for the nudge, ChatGPT!). As much as Iâ€™d love to spend endless hours crafting the perfect article/post, thereâ€™s a whole platform to build. ðŸ˜‰

Thank you for joining me at the start of this adventure. Stay tuned for more updates, milestones, and maybe a few more AI-generated articles & posts along the way! ðŸš€
