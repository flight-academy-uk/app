Write an article for a weekly update containing the following information:
- Work has only occured last weekend and this weekend (busy during the weekdays, and had not been able to get around to it)
- Implemented hero section to the website index page
- Implemented dark/light mode
- CSS only navigation and search overlay (allowing for greater accessibility/less reliance on JS)

Weekly Update: Progress on the Hero Section and Navigation Enhancements

It’s been a busy week, and unfortunately, development time was limited to the weekends. While the weekdays were packed with other commitments, I made significant progress on the project over the last two weekends, focusing on critical aspects of the website’s design and functionality. Here's a breakdown of the achievements for this update:
Hero Section Implementation

The hero section of the index page has been implemented successfully! This visually striking element is the first thing users see when visiting the site. It sets the tone with a clean, responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. Key features include:

    A bold headline that captures the site's core message.
    Supporting visuals that enhance the user experience and communicate the website's purpose.
    Buttons and links integrated into the hero section for smooth navigation to other parts of the site.

This addition gives the index page a polished and professional feel, making a strong first impression on users.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle

To enhance user experience and accessibility, I’ve implemented a dark/light mode toggle. This feature:

    Allows users to choose between a visually comfortable light mode and a sleek, modern dark mode.
    Preserves user preferences across sessions using local storage, ensuring their choice is respected every time they visit the site.
    Includes smooth transitions between modes for a polished and visually appealing experience.

This update improves usability and adds a layer of personalization to the site, making it more user-friendly and inclusive.
CSS-Only Navigation and Search Overlay

In line with the goal of creating a more accessible website, I’ve built the navigation and search overlay with CSS-only solutions, minimizing reliance on JavaScript. Key benefits of this approach include:

    Greater accessibility: By avoiding JavaScript dependencies, the navigation and search overlay are more reliable for users with assistive technologies.
    Improved performance: With fewer scripts to load, page performance is faster and more efficient.
    Simplified maintenance: The CSS-based implementation reduces complexity, making the codebase easier to maintain.

The navigation includes a sleek hamburger menu for mobile users, while the search overlay provides an intuitive way to explore the site’s content. Both features function smoothly across devices and screen sizes.
Looking Ahead

While progress has been slower during the weekdays, these updates mark significant strides in the site’s development. Moving forward, I aim to:

    Refine the hero section further by incorporating feedback and adding interactive elements.
    Expand the dark/light mode feature to ensure consistent design across all components.
    Optimize and test the CSS-based navigation and search overlay for edge cases and accessibility improvements.

Thank you for following along with this week’s update. I’m excited to continue building and sharing progress as we move closer to launch!

Write another few paragraphs on "looking ahead" mentioning revisiting the index page/hero section and navigation for tablet & desktop screen sizes. Further, the index page needs several more components for marketing & outlining of features of flight-academy uk. Throughout the next week, a focus will be placed on starting implementation of login, SSO and authentication/authorisation for the portal. This will consist of beginning definition of the user domain, and working with OAuth providers to create sessions, authentication through tokens. This will be a seperate Astro application within the repository and contain frontends for flight school students, instructors, administrators and other relevant users.
```

``` plaintext
While the hero section and navigation have laid a strong foundation, I’ll revisit these components to ensure they provide an exceptional experience across tablet and desktop screen sizes. Mobile-first development has ensured a solid base for smaller screens, but additional refinements will optimise layouts and interactivity for larger devices. Enhancing spacing, typography, and visual elements for these screen sizes will provide a consistent, professional appearance across all platforms.

In addition, the index page still needs several more components to fully convey the value and features of Flight Academy UK. Upcoming sections will focus on marketing the academy's unique offerings and outlining key benefits for prospective students and instructors. This includes areas highlighting course details, testimonials, and clear calls to action, ensuring visitors quickly understand the academy's mission and services.

A major focus for the upcoming week will be the implementation of login, single sign-on (SSO), and authentication/authorization functionality for the portal. This work will include:

- Defining the user domain to accommodate different user roles, including flight school students, instructors, administrators, and other relevant stakeholders.
- Collaborating with OAuth providers to handle secure user authentication via token-based systems.
- Establishing session management and ensuring a seamless login experience across devices.

This authentication functionality will be built within a separate Astro application housed in the same repository. The application will feature frontends tailored to each user role, providing intuitive interfaces that cater to their specific needs and workflows. Students, for instance, will have access to their progress and lessons, while administrators will manage courses and users.

These additions mark an exciting phase in the project, as the groundwork for user engagement and secure access is laid. This week’s efforts will move us closer to realising a robust, fully-featured platform for Flight Academy UK. Stay tuned for updates as these critical components come to life!
